Make a program called replace that takes a filename and two strings, let’s call themlols1 and s2, which are NOT empty.lolIt will open the file, and write its contents to FILENAME.replace, after replacinglolevery occurrence of s1 with s2.lolAll the member functions of the class std::string are allowed, except replace. Uselolthem wisely!lolOf course, you will handle errors as best you can. Do not use the C file manipulationlolfunctions, because that would be cheating, and cheating’s bad, m’kay?lolYou will turn in some test files to show your program works.lol
